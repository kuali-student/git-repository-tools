#
# The svn.externals file controls what local directories appear in the
# checkout, and what actual location inside Subversion they represent.
# 
# This enables development streams to be independently managed and released 
# while also providing a single spot to perform an aggregated Kuali Student checkout
# and build
#
# The SVN command for using this file to create SVN external definitions is
# 
# svn propset svn:externals -F svn.externals .
#
# *** IMPORTANT ***
# you must rerun the svn propset command and commit after editing any of
# the external paths
